# Use Cases Section - Brainstorming & Planning

## Goal
Add a new "Use Cases" section to the navigation bar with a dropdown menu, similar to "Industries". This section will highlight how Orwell's AI agents can be applied to specific business functions.

## 1. Proposed Use Cases
Based on the initial request, here are the core use cases we should cover, along with some additional suggestions:

### Core (Requested)
*   **Sales Agents**: 
    *   *Focus*: Outbound outreach, lead qualification, meeting scheduling, follow-ups.
    *   *Value*: Increase pipeline velocity, 24/7 engagement.
*   **Customer Support**: 
    *   *Focus*: L1/L2 support, ticket triage, FAQ resolution, 24/7 availability.
    *   *Value*: Reduced response time, lower support costs, improved CSAT.
*   **Workflow Automation** (formerly Internal Operations): 
    *   *Focus*: Document processing (e.g., parsing emails/PDFs for data entry), employee onboarding, IT helpdesk, process automation.
    *   *Value*: Streamlined workflows, reduced manual data entry, reduced internal friction.
    *   *Example*: Similar to the Healthcare Prior Auth use case (Ingest -> Extract -> Action).

### Additional Suggestions (For consideration)
*   **Recruiting / HR**: Screening candidates, scheduling interviews, answering policy questions.
*   **Marketing**: Content generation, social media monitoring, campaign analysis.
*   **Data Analysis**: Generating reports from raw data, answering "what if" questions.

## 2. Proposed Page Structure
To ensure consistency and high conversion, each Use Case page should follow a similar template:

1.  **Hero Section**: 
    *   Headline: Specific to the function (e.g., "Supercharge Your Sales Team with AI Agents").
    *   Subheadline: One-sentence value prop.
    *   Visual: Abstract representation of the agent working in that context or a UI mockup.
    *   CTA: "Book Demo" or "See Sales Agents in Action".

2.  **The Problem**: 
    *   Briefly address the pain points (e.g., "Sales reps spend 60% of their time on non-selling activities").

3.  **How Orwell Helps (Capabilities)**:
    *   3-4 key features specific to this use case (e.g., "Automated Lead Qualification", "Instant Meeting Booking").
    *   Icon + Title + Short description for each.

4.  **Real-World Scenario / Workflow**:
    *   A step-by-step visual or description of how the agent interacts (e.g., "Lead fills form -> Agent calls within 2 mins -> Qualifies -> Books meeting").

5.  **Benefits / ROI**:
    *   Metrics-driven outcomes (e.g., "3x more meetings booked", "50% reduction in support costs").

6.  **FAQ (Optional)**:
    *   Specific questions for that department (e.g., "Does it integrate with Salesforce?").

7.  **Bottom CTA**:
    *   Final push to convert.

## 3. Navigation Structure
*   **New Item**: "Use Cases" (between Platform and Industries? or after Industries?)
*   **Dropdown**: Similar style to Industries, listing the selected use cases.

## Questions for Discussion
1.  Which 3-5 use cases should we prioritize for launch?
2.  Do we have specific "hero" imagery or assets for these, or should we generate abstract tech visuals?
3.  Should "Use Cases" come before or after "Industries" in the navbar?
